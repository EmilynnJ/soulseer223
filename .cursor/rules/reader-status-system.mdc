description: Specification for implementing and managing the three-state reader availability system in psychic reading platforms

# reader-status-system

Implements a real-time availability tracking system for psychic readers with three distinct states:

## Status States
- Online: Indicated by green visual marker
- Busy: Indicated by yellow visual marker
- Away: Indicated by blue visual marker

## Core Implementation
Located in `/styles.css`

The status system provides visual indicators for immediate availability recognition, enabling users to quickly identify which readers are currently accepting new sessions.

## Business Rules
1. Each reader must be in exactly one of the three states at any time
2. Status indicators are real-time reflections of reader availability
3. Visual markers provide instant recognition of reader state

Importance Score: 35/100
- While the status system is essential for session coordination, the current implementation is primarily visual without complex business logic
- The three-state system represents a basic but necessary component for matching readers with clients
