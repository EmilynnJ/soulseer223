# stream-management

Importance Score: 35/100

The stream management system implements two core functionalities for psychic reading sessions:

1. Active Stream Status
- Displays real-time viewer counts for ongoing streams
- Integrates with reader availability states to show stream status
- Located in /index.html

2. Scheduled Stream Management
- Shows countdown timer for upcoming scheduled streams
- Displays "time-to-start" information for future sessions
- Located in /index.html

Core Components:

```
/index.html
|- stream-status
   |- viewer-count
   |- stream-schedule
   |- time-display
```

The system provides basic stream status tracking but relies on external backend services for:
- Actual viewer count updates
- Schedule management
- Stream state transitions
- Real-time updates
